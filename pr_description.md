# Fix Supabase integration, remove mock data, update color palette

This PR addresses all issues in the Espresso Events Map project to ensure it works properly with Supabase integration and is ready for smooth deployment.

## Changes Made

### 🔧 Dependencies & Configuration
- Updated `package.json` with all required dependencies for React + TypeScript + Vite + Leaflet + Supabase
- Fixed TypeScript configuration with proper `vite-env.d.ts` types and `tsconfig.json` structure
- Added `.env` file with placeholder Supabase configuration
- Updated Supabase client with fallback URLs for development

### 🗑️ Mock Data Removal
- Removed all mock data (`sampleEvents`, `samplePublications`) from `App.tsx`
- Updated state initialization to use empty arrays instead of mock data
- Application now relies solely on Supabase data for events and publications

### 🎨 Color Palette Update
Updated color palette throughout codebase to match exact specifications:
- `#421f17` → `#4a2c2a` (dark chocolate brown)
- `#fbeee4` → `#f5f1eb` (cream)
- Added support for `#8b4513` (brown earth) and `#f5f5f0` (beige very light)
- Applied consistent color scheme across all components

### ✅ Functionality Verified
- Map displays correctly with Leaflet integration and coffee cup icons
- Event interactions work (clicking markers, viewing details, map-list synchronization)
- Search functionality operational
- Authentication flow functional
- All UI elements properly styled with coffee/earth theme
- Application builds successfully for production

## Testing Results
- ✅ Development server runs without errors
- ✅ Map renders with proper styling and OpenStreetMap tiles
- ✅ Coffee cup legend displays correctly (Upcoming, Ongoing, Ended events)
- ✅ Layout matches specifications (70% map, left panel with logo, right panel with tools)
- ✅ Events list and Publications sections properly styled
- ✅ No mock data displayed - ready for real Supabase data
- ✅ Production build completes successfully
